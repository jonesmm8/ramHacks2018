Project was meant to pull a collection of tweets, display to user and allow them to vote on a scale of 1-5 how much they thought it was a bot. Based on the voting the individual tweets would recieve scores based on how bot-like they appeared to the public. Individual users would aquire points and those points would lead to badged and awards to show how much they participated and how inline they were with other peoples votes. 

Unable to link mongoDB with logstash as input and output. Versions not in sync for uri. Unable to connect data base as input any other way because mongoDB is in the cloud and logstash has no cloud capabilities not even through the elastic cloud. Also there wasn't enough starage space to run an inctance of logstasher on google cloud and after paying to increase storing there was then connection issues with elasticsearch. We also were unable to get data to enter the mongoDB using test code given by company but there's a strong possiblity we were just doing it wrong somehow. Because there was no input to logstash we were unable to implement Kibana.
